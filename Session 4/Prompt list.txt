A qualidade JBL é algo indiscutível, ótima qualidade de som, acabamento impecável, funcionamento perfeito. Os produtos JBL são caros, mas valem a pena, pelo preço poderiam fornecer um carregador. Uso em pequenos eventos como churrasco em família ou amigos e ela atende perfeitamente. A bateria não é das melhores, entrega umas 4 a 5 horas de uso moderado. Seu carregamento é bem rápido. O atendimento da loja me surpreendeu. Adorei a aquisição.

Customer review: So, they still had the 17 piece system on seasonal sale for around $49 in the month of November, about half off, but for some reason (call it price gouging) around the second week of December the prices all went up to about anywhere from between $70-$89 for the same system. And the 11 piece system went up around $10 or so in price also from the earlier sale price of $29. So it looks okay, but if you look at the base, the part where the blade locks into place doesn't look as good as in previous editions from a few years ago, but I plan to be very gentle with it (example, I crush very hard items like beans, ice, rice, etc. in the blender first then pulverize them in the serving size I want in the blender then switch to the whipping blade for a finer flour, and use the cross cutting blade first when making smoothies, then use the flat blade if I need them finer/less pulpy). Special tip when making smoothies, finely cut and freeze the fruits and vegetables (if using spinach-lightly stew soften the spinach then freeze until ready for use-and if making sorbet, use a small to medium sized food processor) that you plan to   that way you can avoid adding so much ice if at all-when making your smoothie. After about a year, the  motor was making a funny noise. I called customer service but the warranty expired already, so I had to buy another one. FYI: The overall quality has gone done in these types of products, so they are kind of counting on brand recognition and consumer loyalty to maintain sales. Got it in about two days.
Review sentiment: Negative.
