# [CHAT-2.4] Spreadsheet formula

## Input

Google Sheet formula which copies all rows from sheet1 where column "A" contains word "iphone".

## Output (ChatGPT)

To copy all rows from `Sheet1` where column "A" contains the word "iphone" (case-insensitive), you can use the following formula in a new sheet or in a new range on the same sheet:

```
excel
=FILTER(Sheet1!A:Z, REGEXMATCH(LOWER(Sheet1!A:A), "iphone"))
```

### Explanation:
- `FILTER(Sheet1!A:Z, ...)` is used to return the rows from `Sheet1` where the condition is true.
- `REGEXMATCH(LOWER(Sheet1!A:A), "iphone")` checks if the word "iphone" (case-insensitive) is found in column "A" of `Sheet1`. 
  - `LOWER(Sheet1!A:A)` converts all text in column A to lowercase.
  - `REGEXMATCH(...)` checks if the lowercase text contains the substring "iphone".

If you only need specific columns from `Sheet1` (for example, columns A and B), you can adjust the range like this:

```
excel
=FILTER(Sheet1!A:B, REGEXMATCH(LOWER(Sheet1!A:A), "iphone"))
```

This will only return columns A and B for the rows that contain the word "iphone" in column A.

## Input

Excel formula which copies all rows from sheet1 where column "A" contains word "iphone".

## Output (ChatGPT)

In Excel, you can't directly use a formula to "copy" rows as you can in Google Sheets. However, you can achieve this effect using a combination of the `FILTER` function (available in Excel 365 and Excel 2021) or an array formula with `INDEX`, `MATCH`, and `IF` functions. Here's how to do it for each version:

### Method 1: Using `FILTER` (Excel 365 or Excel 2021)
If you are using Excel 365 or Excel 2021, you can use the `FILTER` function to extract rows where column "A" contains the word "iphone":

```excel
=FILTER(Sheet1!A:Z, ISNUMBER(SEARCH("iphone", Sheet1!A:A)))
```

### Explanation:
- `Sheet1!A:Z` is the range of data you want to copy. This can be adjusted to any specific range, e.g., `Sheet1!A1:D100`.
- `SEARCH("iphone", Sheet1!A:A)` checks if the word "iphone" appears in column A. `SEARCH` is case-insensitive, so it will match "iphone", "iPhone", "IPHONE", etc.
- `ISNUMBER(SEARCH(...))` returns `TRUE` if the word "iphone" is found, and `FALSE` otherwise.
- `FILTER(...)` returns the rows where the condition is `TRUE`.

### Method 2: Using an Array Formula (For Older Versions of Excel)
If you're using an older version of Excel (Excel 2019 or earlier), you can use an array formula to extract rows. This method is a bit more complicated and requires entering it as an array formula (press `Ctrl + Shift + Enter`).

1. Suppose your data is in columns A to Z on `Sheet1`, and you want to extract rows where column "A" contains the word "iphone".
2. In the first row of your new sheet, enter the following formula:

```excel
=IFERROR(INDEX(Sheet1!A$1:A$100, SMALL(IF(ISNUMBER(SEARCH("iphone", Sheet1!A$1:A$100)), ROW(Sheet1!A$1:A$100)-ROW(Sheet1!A$1)+1), ROW(1:1))), "")
```

3. After entering the formula, press **Ctrl + Shift + Enter** to create an array formula. You should see curly braces `{}` around the formula in the formula bar.

4. Drag this formula across to cover all the columns you want to copy (e.g., from A to Z) and then drag it down to cover the number of rows you expect to extract.

### Explanation:
- `SEARCH("iphone", Sheet1!A$1:A$100)` checks if the word "iphone" appears in each cell of column A.
- `ISNUMBER(...)` returns `TRUE` or `FALSE` based on whether the word is found.
- `ROW(Sheet1!A$1:A$100)-ROW(Sheet1!A$1)+1` generates an array of row numbers for those where "iphone" is found.
- `SMALL(..., ROW(1:1))` extracts the N-th smallest row number, where N corresponds to the current row number (as you drag down).
- `INDEX(Sheet1!A$1:A$100, ...)` returns the actual data from that row.
- `IFERROR(..., "")` ensures that if there are no more matches, the formula returns a blank.

This method works well for smaller ranges and older versions of Excel.

### Notes:
- You can adjust the range (`A$1:A$100`) based on the number of rows you have in `Sheet1`.
- The formula can be adapted for different columns or ranges by modifying the column references.
