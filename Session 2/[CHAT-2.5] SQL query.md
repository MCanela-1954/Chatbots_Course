# [CHAT-2.5] SQL queries

## Input

SQL query for BigQuery that pulls from my ecommerce.products table and returns id, cost, name, brand, retail_price, and sku. The query should be filtered to show only "Men" department and "Swim" category.

## Output (ChatGPT)

To write a SQL query for BigQuery that pulls the specified fields (`id`, `cost`, `name`, `brand`, `retail_price`, and `sku`) from the `ecommerce.products` table and filters for products in the "Men" department and "Swim" category, you can use the following query:

```
sql

SELECT 
  id, 
  cost, 
  name, 
  brand, 
  retail_price, 
  sku
FROM 
  `your_project_id.your_dataset_id.ecommerce.products`
WHERE 
  department = 'Men'
  AND category = 'Swim';
```

### Explanation:
- `id`, `cost`, `name`, `brand`, `retail_price`, and `sku` are the columns you're selecting.
- The `FROM` clause specifies the `ecommerce.products` table. Replace `your_project_id` and `your_dataset_id` with your actual project and dataset IDs in BigQuery.
- The `WHERE` clause filters the results to only include products where the `department` is "Men" and the `category` is "Swim".

### Notes:
- Make sure the column names (`department`, `category`, etc.) match the actual column names in your `ecommerce.products` table. Adjust them if necessary.
- If your department or category names are case-sensitive or have different formats (like "men" vs "Men"), make sure to account for that in the query.

## Input

I need a SQL query for MySQL. My schema name is ecommerce and the tables are users and orders. I want an output that gives me each user's name (users.name) and email, with the total number of orders each user has made, and the total number of items they have purchased (orders.num_of_item). The orders table has a user_id column. I also need to filter to only show orders with status of "Complete" and created_at later than Jan 1, 2020. Order the results by the total number of orders from highest at the top to lowest at the bottom.

## Output (Gemini)

Sure, here is the SQL query you requested:

```
sql

SELECT u.name, u.email, COUNT(o.id) AS total_orders, SUM(o.num_of_item) AS total_items
FROM ecommerce.users u
INNER JOIN ecommerce.orders o ON u.id = o.user_id
WHERE o.status = "Complete"
  AND o.created_at > '2020-01-01'
GROUP BY u.id, u.name, u.email
ORDER BY total_orders DESC;
```

This query will output each user's name, email, total number of orders, and total number of items purchased from the `ecommerce` schema's `users` and `orders` tables. Here's a breakdown of the code:

1. **SELECT:** This clause specifies the columns you want to retrieve from the tables.
2. **FROM:** This clause specifies the tables involved in the query (users and orders).
3. **INNER JOIN:** This clause joins the `users` and `orders` tables based on the matching `user_id` values.
4. **WHERE:** This clause filters the results to include only orders with a status of "Complete" and a created date after January 1, 2020.
5. **GROUP BY:** This clause groups the results by user (using `u.id`, `u.name`, and `u.email`) so that the aggregate functions (COUNT and SUM) can be applied correctly.
6. **COUNT(o.id) AS total_orders:** This calculates the total number of orders for each user.
7. **SUM(o.num_of_item) AS total_items:** This calculates the total number of items purchased by each user across all their orders.
8. **ORDER BY total_orders DESC:** This clause sorts the results by the total number of orders in descending order (highest to lowest).

I hope this helps!
