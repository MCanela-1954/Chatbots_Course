I need a SQL query for MySQL. My schema name is ecommerce and the tables are users and orders. I want an output that gives me each user's name (users.name) and email, with the total number of orders each user has made, and the total number of items they have purchased (orders.num_of_item). The orders table has a user_id column. I also need to filter to only show orders with status of "Complete" and created_at later than Jan 1, 2020. Order the results by the total number of orders from highest at the top to lowest at the bottom.

        "description": "I came here with a group of 14 and made a reservation a few weeks in advance. The space is great for that and I highly recommend a reservation regardless of your party size. I chose this place because it's good for a diverse group of eaters: vegan, dairy free, meat free, and everyone else. The restaurant was really accommodating for everyone and we all enjoyed the food and sharing/tasting. \n\nHere's the thing though - they charge $25 per person for a paella regardless of size or sharing. So if it's a paella to share for 2 it's $50. If you want a 3 portion paella it's $75. I shared the vegan one which had rice and veggies. Very good - but no protein and we both left kinda hungry. Someone else got one covered in seafood: mussels, clams, shrimp, etc for the same price. Then 1/2 the table drank while the other 1/2 didn't. So my only recommendation would be to ask ahead of time to separate the bill. Some of our party got a great deal while the other 1/2 WAY overpaid. \n\nI chose this place because I'd eaten here as a group before. Everyone loved the food and we had a great time. And for our out-of-towners they really enjoyed something so different.",
