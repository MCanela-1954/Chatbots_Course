I chose this place because it's good for a diverse group of eaters: vegan, dairy free, meat free, and everyone else. The restaurant was really accommodating for everyone and we all enjoyed the food and sharing/tasting. \n\nHere's the thing though - they charge $25 per person for a paella regardless of size or sharing. So if it's a paella to share for 2 it's $50. If you want a 3 portion paella it's $75. I shared the vegan one which had rice and veggies. Very good - but no protein and we both left kinda hungry. Someone else got one covered in seafood: mussels, clams, shrimp, etc for the same price. Then 1/2 the table drank while the other 1/2 didn't. So my only recommendation would be to ask ahead of time to separate the bill. Some of our party got a great deal while the other 1/2 WAY overpaid. \n\nI chose this place because I'd eaten here as a group before. Everyone loved the food and we had a great time. And for our out-of-towners they really enjoyed something so different.",
