Let's solve this age puzzle!

*   **Ten years ago:** Let your current age be â€˜x'. Your brother's age was then 'x - 10'. The problem states that your age was four times your brother's age at that time, so:  x = 4(x - 10)

*   **Right now:** Your current age is 'x'. Your brother's current age is 'x - 10 + 10 = x'. The problem states that your age is double your brother's age now, so: x = 2x

Now we solve the equations. From the second equation:

x = 2x

x = 0 (This doesn't make sense in the context of ages)

Let's re-examine the problem with a slightly different approach. Let 'b' be your brother's current age.

*   **Ten years ago:** Your age was x and your brother's age was b - 10.  We were told that ten years ago, your age (x) was four times your brother's age:  x = 4(b - 10)

*   **Right now:** Your current age is x and your brother's current age is b. We are told that right now, your age (x) is double your brother's age: x = 2b

Now we have two equations with two variables:

1.  x = 4(b - 10)

2.  x = 2b

Since both expressions equal 'x', we can set them equal to each other:

4(b - 10) = 2b

4b - 40 = 2b

2b = 40

b = 20

Now that we know your brother's current age (b = 20), we can find your current age using the equation x = 2b:

x = 2 * 20

x = 40

Therefore, you are 40 years old.

The answer is (B).

## Input

Ten years ago, my age was four times the age of my brother. Right now, it is the double. How old am I?

(A) 20 years old &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (B) 40 years old &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (C) 25 years old &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (D) 35 years old &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (E) None of the others

## Output (Gemini 2.0)

Let $M$ be my current age and $B$ be my brother's current age.

According to the problem statement:

Ten years ago, my age was $M - 10$, and my brother's age was $B - 10$. At that time, my age was four times my brother's age:

$$M - 10 = 4(B - 10)$$$$M - 10 = 4B - 40$$$$M = 4B - 30 \quad (*)$$

Right now, my age is double my brother's age:

$$M = 2B \quad (**)$$

Now we have a system of two linear equations with two variables:

1) $M = 4B - 30$

2) $M = 2B$

We can substitute the second equation into the first one:

$$2B = 4B - 30$$Now, we can solve for $B$:$$30 = 4B - 2B$$$$30 = 2B$$$$B = \frac{30}{2}$$

$$B = 15$$

So, my brother's current age is 15 years old.

Now we can find my current age using the second equation ($M = 2B$):

$$M = 2 \times 15$$

$$M = 30$$

So, my current age is 30 years old.

Let's check if this solution satisfies the first condition (ten years ago):

Ten years ago, I was $30 - 10 = 20$ years old.

Ten years ago, my brother was $15 - 10 = 5$ years old.

Is my age four times my brother's age then? $20 = 4 \times 5$, which is true.

Therefore, my current age is 30 years old. This is not one of the options provided.

Let's double-check the calculations.

Equation 1: $M - 10 = 4(B - 10) \implies M - 10 = 4B - 40 \implies M = 4B - 30$

Equation 2: $M = 2B$

Substituting $M = 2B$ into the first equation:

$2B = 4B - 30$

$30 = 4B - 2B$

$30 = 2B$

$B = 15$

Then $M = 2 \times 15 = 30$.

My current age is 30. Ten years ago I was 20, and my brother was 5. $20 = 4 \times 5$. Currently I am 30 and my brother is 15. $30 = 2 \times 15$. The solution is consistent with the problem statement.

Since 30 is not among the options, the answer is (E) None of the others.
