# [PROMPT-2.1] Math word problem

## Input

Ten friends have a dinner in a restaurant. Since four of them don't carry any money, the other six friends pay for them. How much cheaper for each of these six friends would it be if everybody had paid?

## Output (Gemini 2.0)

**1. Determine the total cost:**

* Let's assume the total cost of the dinner is 'X'.

**2. Calculate the cost per person if everyone paid:**

* Cost per person (if all paid) = X / 10

**3. Calculate the cost per person when only six paid:**

* Cost per person (when only six paid) = X / 6

**4. Calculate the difference in cost:**

* Difference = Cost per person (when only six paid) - Cost per person (if all paid)
    * Difference = (X / 6) - (X / 10)
    * Difference = (5X - 3X) / 30 
    * Difference = 2X / 30
    * Difference = X / 15

Therefore:

It would be X/15 cheaper for each of the six friends who paid if everybody had contributed to the bill. 

Note:

* This calculation assumes that the cost of the dinner is evenly divided among those who pay. 
* 'X' represents the total cost of the dinner.

## Input

Ten friends have a dinner in a restaurant. Since four of them don't carry any money, the other six friends pay for them. How much cheaper for each of these six friends would it be if everybody had paid?

(A) 60% &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (B) 30% &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (C) 45% &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (D) 40% &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (E) 50%

## Output (Gemini 2.0)

**1. Determine the initial cost per person:**

* Let the total cost of the dinner be 'x'.
* Initially, 6 friends pay for the entire meal, so each pays x/6.

**2. Determine the cost per person if everyone paid:**

* If all 10 friends paid, each would pay x/10.

**3. Calculate the difference in cost:**

* Difference in cost per person = (x/6) - (x/10) 
                                        = (5x - 3x) / 30 
                                        = 2x / 30 
                                        = x / 15

**4. Calculate the percentage reduction:**

* Percentage reduction = (Difference in cost / Initial cost) * 100
                             = (x/15) / (x/6) * 100
                             = (x/15) * (6/x) * 100
                             = 6/15 * 100
                             = 40%

Therefore, it would be 40% cheaper for each of the six friends if everybody had paid.

Answer: (D) 40%
